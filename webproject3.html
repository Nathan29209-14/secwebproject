          What are the historic terms of the Treaty, meaning what was

          Treaty 1, signed in 1871, gave 160 acres of land to each family of five,<span

          and included extra promises like clothing and farming tools for chiefs, added in 1875. The “outside promises” were acknowledged by the government
            in 1875 after Indigenous leaders insisted that verbal promises made during negotiations—like
            clothing for chiefs and farming tools—were just as important as what was written in the treaty.
