          What makes this Treaty 1 different from other Treaties in Canada. 
        </h3>
        <br/>
        <p class="typography1">Treaty 1 is different because it was the first Numbered Treaty <span style="color: black; font-size: large; font-weight: bold;">(signed in 1871)</span>, included later “outside promises” like 
          farming tools and clothing not in the written text, and was understood by 
          Indigenous peoples as a land-sharing agreement, while the Crown saw it as land surrender</p>
