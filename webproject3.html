          Treaty 1, signed in 1871, gave 160 acres of land to each family of five,<span
            style="color: black; font-size: large; font-weight: bold">
            <!-- The <span> tag is used to style part of the text -->
              $3 per person every year, promised schools, banned alcohol on 
              reserves,</span>
          <!--font-weight changes the weight like for example "bold"-->
          <!--font-size change the size of the words-->
          and included extra promises like clothing and farming tools for chiefs, added in 1875. The “outside promises” were acknowledged by the government
            in 1875 after Indigenous leaders insisted that verbal promises made during negotiations—like
            clothing for chiefs and farming tools—were just as important as what was written in the treaty.
        </p>
        <p class="typography1"> Treaty 1, signed in 1871, was made over eight days at Lower Fort Garry with about 1,000 Indigenous people. It didn’t give them rights to hunt and fish, even though it was expected. Instead, it set up land for reserves near rivers like Turtle, Crane, and Fairford, while keeping settlers' land. The treaty said the government had to count the people every August and give each
            family $15 worth of things like blankets, clothes, and traps. It also said the Indigenous people had to follow Canadian law, keep the peace, and help with justice. It put them under full Canadian control to make them part of Canadian society. The treaty was seen as a promise from the "Great White Queen Mother"
            to treat them fairly and protect them, and chiefs were given medals as symbols of this promise. </p>

          What makes this Treaty 1 different from other Treaties in Canada. 
        </h3>
          </section>
        <br/>
        <p class="typography1">Treaty 1 is different because it was the first Numbered Treaty <span style="color: black; font-size: large; font-weight: bold;">(signed in 1871)</span>, included later “outside promises” like 
          farming tools and clothing not in the written text, and was understood by 
          Indigenous peoples as a land-sharing agreement, while the Crown saw it as land surrender</p>
          <p class="typography1">Treaty 1 was different because it promised schools on reserves if wanted, banned alcohol on reserves, required yearly counts of people with $15 worth of goods given to each family, made the Indigenous people follow Canadian laws and keep the peace, and put them under full control 
              of the government, which was not always
              the case in later treaties.</p>

          How is the Treaty 1 implemented today?  
        </h3>
        </section>
        <p class="typography1">
          <!--font-style changes the style of the words-->
          Treaty 1 is implemented today through things like annual payments, development of <span
            style="color: black; font-size: large; font-weight: bold">
            <!-- The <span> tag is used to style part of the text -->
              Indigenous-run lands like Naawi-Oodena</span>
          <!--font-weight changes the weight like for example "bold"-->
          <!--font-size change the size of the words-->
          , and efforts to honor treaty rights 
        through education, land use, and reconciliation projects
        </p>
        <p class="typography1">Today, Treaty 1 is carried out in more ways than just yearly payments and land. For example, the Naawi-Oodena urban reserve in Winnipeg is being built by seven First Nations into a place with homes, stores, cultural spaces, and parks. This helps create jobs and brings communities together. The
            treaty is also followed by teaching about it in schools, planning how land is used, and doing 
          projects that try to fix past wrongs.</p>
