          <p class="typography1"> A treaty is a formal agreement between two or more groups, like governments or Nations, that explains promises, rules, and responsibilities 
            they agree to follow. There are 11 Numbered Treaties in Canada, signed between 1871 and 1921, along with several other historic agreements and land claims.</p>

        <p class="typography1">Lower Fort Garry is a trading post built in 1830 by the Hudson’s Bay Company, is about 20 miles north of Winnipeg and was picked because it was on high ground, safe from floods, and easy to reach by river. People also called it the “Stone Fort” because it was made of
            limestone. Over the years, it was used as a supply center, a factory area, and a training spot for police. Today, it’s a National Historic Site that remembers its important role in Canadian history and the treaty. Here is an image of
            Lower Fort Garry, the site of the negotiations:</p>
